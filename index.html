    <p>We all love Slack. Slack creates a “virtual hallway” where ideas flow
    freely, questions are answered by the collective, and debate on topics
    of interest flourishes. This is wonderful. However, as working-students
    (or one might argue, members of the 21st century), we recognize that
    our limited time is no match for the deluge of information available on Slack.
    This leads to a serious case of <strong>slack anxiety</strong>. When there is all
    this useful and valuable information out there, finding the information you
    need becomes a case of finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
    <p>Slack already provides a structure for organizing conversations: channels.
    Every team has a number of channels where conversation is housed. The channels
    are sorted by time of message. When a user opens a channel, the most recent
    messages appear first. The user can then scroll up to find older messages.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="SectionSolution">
    <p class="heading">a solution...</p>
    <p>Because we were unsatisfied with Slack's default organizing structure, we created
    <strong>awaybot</strong>. A user simply invites <strong>awaybot</strong> to
    listen to one or more public channels. The bot listens in real time to the
    conversations as they unfold. It continuously uses natural language processing
    algorithms to divide the conversation into topics and summarize these topics.
    When users feel overwhelmed by the deluge of information on Slack, they
    simply query <strong>awaybot</strong>. The user provides a command, the name
    of the channel, and a time duration. The bot returns a high-level summary of the topics
    that transpired during that duration. It's never been easier to get summaries
    of the conversations you missed!</p>

    We use the <a href="https://api.slack.com/rtm" target="_blank">Slack real time messaging API</a>
    to listen to the Slack channel. We use a simple
    <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a> producer to write this
    information to a Kafka cluster. We then use a Kafka
    consumer to store the data in a
    <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cassandra</a> cluster from which our
    NLP builds summaries for different time durations. These summaries are
    stored in SimpleDB. When the user queries the Slackbot for a summary, the
    request goes to a python layer that queries
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/simpledb/" target="_blank">SimpleDB</a> for
    the relevant information and serves it to the user as the Slackbot.

  <div id="SectionNLP">
    <p class="heading">the natural language processing (nlp)...</p>
    <p>We have successfully created a topic generator that appropriately splits
    conversation into relevant topics based on two key ideas: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwEDqldf45ESeUdnUzRNQ0xBN0E" target="_blank">implicit reply</a>
    and concept similarity.</p>
    <p>Implicit Reply clusters messages based on the probability that a message is a
    reply to a previous message. It does not rely on the assumption that related
    messages share similar words. This is helpful because it is not uncommon for
    users who are engaged in conversation on a single topic to interchange words
    used for similar ideas.</p>
    <p>We calculate concept similarity by comparing the geometric representations
    of words and sentences using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec" target="_blank">
    Google's Word2Vec models</a>. We first stem the words, and then compare the
    distances between the message vectors. Messages closer together are closer in
    semantic meaning. Messages farther apart are semantically more dissimilar.</p>

    <img src="static/img/topicgenerator1_v2.png" alt="topic_generator_viz" width="700px" align="middle">
    </center>
    <p>Once the topic generation is complete, we summarize the topics using word clouds.
    These word clouds are built around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf" target="_blank">
    term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)</a> statistics of the words
    in the topic. This statistic is a measure of how important a word is to a topic
    in the corpus of all topics. It does this by calculating how often the word
    appears in that particular topic, offset by how often the word appears in the
    corpus of all topics.</p>

  <div id="SectionNext">
    <p class="heading">next steps...</p>
    <p>We have the opportunity to explore more algorithms for creating and summarizing
    topics. Right now, we use an algorithm that uses TF-IDF statistics to find
    important words in topics. However, there are a
    variety of methods (including <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf" target="_blank">TextRank</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis" target="_blank">Latent Semantic Analysis</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a>, etc.)
    for summarizing information that might prove useful in our application.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, we will launch our code as a Python package to serve
    as base framework. We have written code that is modular and extensible. We
    have documented our code well which makes its accessible to others. We can
    potentially release this code as a package that others in industry and
    research can use as a baseline for further exploration. For example, we
    could imagine our framework as a useful tutorial on the Slack API or a basic
    algorithm for identifying and summarizing topics.</p>

    The slackpack is a team of students enrolled in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data
    Science program. This project is the culmination of a semester-long class (<a
    href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/210" target="_blank">W210
    - Capstone</a>) that brought together all that we had learned during the program.
